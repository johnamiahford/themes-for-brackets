How to install

Installing Themes for Brackets is easy. All you have to do is this:

* Click the tab called "available"
* Type "themes" in the top right search bar
* Locate "Themes for Brackets" (not to be confused with just "Themes", which is a completely other extension, which doesn't style all of Brackets) and click the install button next to it

If you are having trouble installing the extension that way, you can follow theses steps instead (the first approach is to be preffered)

FAQ
==================
* Can I make my own theme?
 - Sure thing, all you need to do is make a new css file in the themes/ folder.<br/><b>HINT:</b> I would recommend looking at already existing themes to find ids and classes.

Troubleshooting
==================
* There are no commands in the themes menu?
 - Try re-opening Brackets, that should help it.
* My line numbers are looking weird?
 - Try hitting F5 (Save changes before doing so!).
